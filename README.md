# Overview

Sometimes we may use some complicated equations to calculate things. 
The calculator is good, but when the things we need to do turn into repeated things and wasting a lot of time.
I always wish there is a better and quicker way to deal with it and save some time. 

I made this function in Java using Swing library. There are four inputs in this function, the initial amount invested, 
the interest rate annually or monthly, and time. The function will calculate the compound interest for you.
