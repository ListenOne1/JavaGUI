# Overview

Sometimes we may use some complicated equations to calculate things. 
The calculator is good, but when the things we need to do turn into repeated things and wasting a lot of time.
I always wish there is a better and quicker way to deal with it and save some time. 

I made this function in Java using Swing library. There are four inputs in this function, the initial amount invested, 
the interest rate annually or monthly, and time.
